# Diff-MTS: Temporal-Augmented Conditional Diffusion Model For Industrial Time Series

Source codes for the paper "Diff-MTS: Temporal-Augmented Conditional Diffusion-Based AIGC for Industrial Time Series Toward the Large Model Era": [Diff-MTS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10697287) [IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics] by Lei Ren, Haiteng Wang, Yuanjun Laili.

Diff-MTS is a novel diffusion-based AIGC model tailored for industrial multivariate time series (MTS). It leverages temporal augmentation and adaptive diffusion techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data, addressing challenges in industrial data generation, including data scarcity, unstable training in GANs, and complex temporal dependencies.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diff-mts.git
   cd diff-mts
2. Install 
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Training the Model
    Train the Diff-MTS model using the following command: 
    ```bash
    python MainCondition.py --epoch 50 --dataset FD001 --lr 2e-3 --state all --model_name DiffUnet --T 500 --window_size 48 --sample_type ddpm --input_size 14
    ```
